# Cubyz Flatpak builds
This is a repo for building [Cubyz](https://github.com/PixelGuys/Cubyz) as a
Flatpak. Patches are applied to use the correct directories. If
[#1909](https://github.com/PixelGuys/Cubyz/issues/1909) gets accepted, these
patches would not be necessary and the project would not need to be built to be
packaged.

# TODO:
- Add appsteam
- Support aarch64 builds
